# Training Task: Composition

**Congratulations!**   
You have recently been re-assigned to maintain an older legacy system managing the employees in your company.
It's primary objective is to handle all the various occupations and to assign respective tasks.

## Your Task
Currently, there's two type of jobs: Janitors and Office Workers.  
However, your manager's recently heard of this hip new thing called "cross-functional team". Being that they're management,  
it came of no surprise to you that they thought this means everyone has to do everything.

You've been asked by your boss to allow office workers to clean as well. After a quick look at the code, you came to the conclusion that
the best way to do this is to refactor the code.

## Next Steps
1. Implement a Cleaner and a Worker class.
2. Add these fields to the two classes.
